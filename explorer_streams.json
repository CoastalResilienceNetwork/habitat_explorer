Note that this is just sensitivity, and actual future impacts will depend on past deposition and future deposition, as well as other factors on the ground that will affect aquatic system sensitivity. Impacts on aquatic systems may be exacerbated by warming stream temperatures and increased precipitation. Sensitivity to acid deposition was created by overlaying EPA alkalinity data and the reclassified Acidic Deposition effects on terrestrial ecosystems dataset developed by the Southern Appalachian Mountains Initiative. A sensitivity index was calculated based on the highest sensitive value from both data sets. Note that some areas on Long Island and at the periphery of the state were not evaluated.

The two event types/sizes used to create the average are large precipitation accumulations over a single day (24 hours) with current recurrence intervals of 1) 10 years and 2) 100 years. In other words, in 2050, how much more often can we expect to see the amount of precipitation that currently is a 100 year recurrence event (1% chance of happening in any year)?
